Title: Tic-Tac-Toe
About: An (almost) fully featured tic-tac-toe game. 3 game modes, 1 player against a (for now) basic Computer Player, two human players (or play against yourself if that's what you're into), and lastly a CPU v CPU mode where you can watch two CPU players battle it out. Made in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
